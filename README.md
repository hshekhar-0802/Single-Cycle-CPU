<h1>Single-Cycle-CPU</h1>
<h2>File Info:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>ALU.circ</em></strong>: This is the representation of the Arithmetic Logic Unit in the CPU.</li>
  <li><strong><em>register.circ</em></strong>: This contains the register file. As of now, there are 9 registers in the file, x0- which always holds the value 0 and 8 other registers x1,x2,x3-x10. Kindly use only these registers while writing code to simulate on this CPU.</li>
  <li><strong><em>processor.circ</em></strong>: This is the top file containing the CPU. It has two memory units, one program counter, one register file and an ALU unit.</li>
